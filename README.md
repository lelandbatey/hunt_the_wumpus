Hunt The Wumpus
===============

This is a simplified version of the classic "Hunt the Wumpus" game, written in Python.


Notes
=====

This was originally written as the final assignment for the first programming class that I ever took. As one would expect, looking back at this code it is HORRENDOUSLY written. Looking at it now, it's a masterpiece of spaghetti and mystery. Please take that into consideration while reading it.
