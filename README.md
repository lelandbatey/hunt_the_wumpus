Hunt The Wumpus
===============

This is a simplified version of the classic "Hunt the Wumpus" game, written in Python.


Notes
-----

This was originally written as the final assignment for the first programming class that I ever took. As one would expect, looking back at this code it is HORRENDOUSLY written. Looking at it now, it's a masterpiece of spaghetti and mystery. Please take that into consideration while reading it.

### Graphics.py

The file `graphics.py` is a simplified wrapper of Tkinter. I'll just copy-paste it's explanation:

    The library is designed to make it very easy for novice programmers to
    experiment with computer graphics in an object oriented fashion. It is
    written by John Zelle for use with the book "Python Programming: An
    Introduction to Computer Science" (Franklin, Beedle & Associates).

Additionally, it should be noted that I have made some extremely small additions to the `graphics.py` library to fit my needs. Within `graphics.py` I will have noted any changes I've made with a string like so: `### BEGIN HTW CHANGES ###`.
